ArcDpsUpdater is a small tool to update arcDps for Guild Wars 2.

Usage: Place the ArcDpsUpdater.exe in your bin64 directory of the Guild Wars 2 game folder. In order to check for updates, execute it. If a new update is available, it'll be downloaded right away, replacing the old d3d9.dll.

That's all.
